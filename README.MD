# Minecraft: PlayStation® Portable Edition
We are working on a "realistic" homebrew of Minecraft.
## Playing
Go into the Releases tab, and download the latest release. The folder should be labeled `MINECRAFT_PSP` and it should have `EBOOT.PBP` in it. Put your PSP into USB mode, and move `MINECRAFT_PSP` to `/path/to/PSP/GAME`, then go to Game/Memory Stick/Minecraft: PlayStation® Portable Edition, which will start the game.
## Building
`make`
